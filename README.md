## üîß Step-by-Step Process  
### Step 1: Data Collection  
- Collected raw data containing over 100,000 rows with fields such as `Booking_ID`, `Pickup_Location`, `Driver_Ratings`, and more.  
- Ensured data consistency by identifying and imputing missing values.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing data using **Python** with the following approach:  
  1. Loaded the dataset using pandas.  
  2. Identified columns containing missing (`NaN`) values.  
  3. Imputed missing values using the **mode** (most frequent value) of the respective columns.  
  4. Saved the cleaned dataset as a new Excel file named `OLA_Data.xlsx`.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel(r'Bookings-100000-Rows.xlsx')
for column in df.columns:
    if df[column].isnull().any():  # Check for missing values
        mode_value = df[column].mode()  # Calculate the mode
        if not mode_value.empty:
            df[column] = df[column].fillna(mode_value[0])  # Fill missing values
df.to_excel('OLA_Data.xlsx', index=False)
```
### Step 3: Data Exploration
- After cleaning the data, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and outliers.
- Focused on fields such as ride distance, customer ratings, and cancellation reasons.
### Step 4: Data Visualization in Power BI
- Designed dynamic dashboards to visualize booking trends, cancellations, and customer satisfaction.
- Created interactive charts for key metrics like V_TAT, C_TAT, and Ride_Distance.
### Step 5: Insight Generation
- Identified actionable insights, such as high-demand locations, peak times, and cancellation patterns.
- Recommended strategies for improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer experience.
### Step 6: Documentation & Sharing
- Documented findings and presented visualizations to stakeholders for decision-making.
- Uploaded the Power BI .pbix file and raw data for easy access.
